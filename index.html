                <h3>Jimmy Bean</h3>
                <p>Beans are nutrient dense with high fiber and starch contents. Thus, they're frequently considered part of the vegetable food group. They may be further classified as a “starchy vegetable,” along with potatoes and squash.</p>

                <h3>Steak platter</h3>
                <p>Choose a plate that's large enough to leave some space between the steak and the side dishes and the edge of the plate, or the plate will look crowded. When plating, pick up the ready steak from the grill with tongs and set it on the plate without scooting it around, to avoid smears.</p>
