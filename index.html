                <h3>Steak platter</h3>
                <p>Choose a plate that's large enough to leave some space between the steak and the side dishes and the edge of the plate, or the plate will look crowded. When plating, pick up the ready steak from the grill with tongs and set it on the plate without scooting it around, to avoid smears.</p>
